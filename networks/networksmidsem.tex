\begin{enumerate}
 \item Consider the following networks:
 \vspace*{2in}
 
 
 Network (a) is directed, network (b) is undirected and bipartite. Write down:
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item The adjacency matrix of (a).
 \item The cocitation matrix of (b).
 \item The indicence matrix of (a).
 \item The projection matrix of (b) onto its black vertices. 
 \item The bibliographic coupling matrix of (a). 
\end{enumerate}


\item 
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the difference between a 2-core and a 2-component? 
\item Give an example of a small network that
has one 2-core but two 2-components.  
\item Give an example of a network which has a 3-core but no 4-core. Justify your answer.
\end{enumerate}


\item 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Define closeness centrality.
\item Consider an undirected tree of $n$ vertices. A particular edge in the tree joins vertices $1$ and $2$
and divides the tee into disjoint regions of $n_1$ and $n_2$ vertices, as sketched here. 
\vspace*{2in}

Let $C_1$ be the closeness
centrality of $1$ and $C_2$ be the closeness centrality of $2$. Show that
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{n_1}{n} = \frac{1}{C_2} + \frac{n_2}{n}
\end{align*}
(Hint: For a vertex in the left hand side, how does the distance of the vertex to $1$ relate to its distance to $2$? 
Use this information to find out the relation between $C_1$ and $C_2$.) 

\end{enumerate}

\item 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Define betweenness centrality of a vertex. 
\item Consider an undirected connected tree of $n$ vertices. 
Suppose that a particular vertex in the tree has degree $k$, so that if we remove that vertex, we get $k$ disjoint parts.
Suppose the size of the $k$ parts is $n_1$, $n_2$,...,$n_k$. Show that the betweenness centrality $x$ of the vertex
is 
\begin{align*}
 x = n^2 - \sum_{i=1}^k n_i^2.
\end{align*}
\item Hence, or otherwise, calculate the betweenness centrality of the $i^{th}$ vertex from the end of a line-graph
of $n$ vertices, i.e. when $n$ vertices are arranged in a row as follows:
\vspace*{1.5in}
\end{enumerate}


\item Suppose a graph on $n$ nodes has the following degree distribution. 
\begin{align*}
 p_k &= \mbox{ fraction of vertices of degree } k\\
\end{align*}
Then, there is a constant $C$ and a constant $\alpha> 1$ such that
\begin{align*}
 p_k = \frac{C}{k^\alpha} \mbox{ for } k \ge 1.
\end{align*}
Recall that $p_k$ is a density function, hence $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} p_k = 1$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Using the above relation give an approximate value for $C$ in terms of the constant $\alpha$.
\item Give a bound on the maximum degree in the graph (remember that the number of nodes is $n$).
\item What is the average degree of the graph?
\end{enumerate}

\item Consider a graph $G$ generated from the Erdos-Renyi random graph model, 
i.e. for every pair of vertices $(i, j)$, the 
edge $E_{ij}$ is a random variable that is given by 
\begin{align*}
  E_{ij} = \begin{cases}
           1 \mbox{ with probability } p;\\
           0 \mbox{ with probability } 1 - p.
            \end{cases}
\end{align*}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item What is the expected degree of the graph $G$?
 \item What is the probability that a vertex has degree exactly $k$ ?
 \item Recall that local clustering coefficient of a node $v$ is defined as the probability that two neighbors of a node $v$ are connected. 
 Using this definition, what is the clustering coefficient of any node? What is then the average local clustering coefficient?
\end{enumerate}





\item 
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the diameter of a clique?
\item What is the diameter of a square lattice with $L$ edges and $L+1$ vertices in each side? The following example has $L=5$.
Give the answer for a general $L$.
\vspace*{2in}

\item A Cayley tree is a symmetric regular tree in which each vertex is connected to the same number $k$ of vertices, 
until we get to the leaves. The following example shows a Cayley tree with $k = 3$. 
\vspace*{2in}

Show that the number of vertices reachable in $d$ steps from the central vertex is $k(k-1)^d$ for $d \ge 1$. 
Hence find an expression for the diameter of the Cayley tree. 

\item Which of the networks in (a), (b) or (c) behave like a ``small world network'', as defined by having a diameter
that increases as $\log(n)$ or slower?
\end{enumerate}

\item 
 A network consists of a ring of n vertices, each of which is connected to the r vertices immediately.
clockwise from it around the ring and to the r vertices immediately anticlockwise. Thus each
vertex has degree k = 2r. You can assume that $n >>r$.
(a) [2 points] How many “connected triples” are there in the network, i.e., a vertex plus an
unordered pair of its neighbors?
(b) [4 points] How many triangles are there in the network, i.e., trios of vertices each connected
to both of the others?
(c) [4 points] What is the clustering coeffcient of the network?


\end{enumerate}
